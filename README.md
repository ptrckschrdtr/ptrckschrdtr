# 👋 Hi, I’m @ptrckschrdtr
**UI designer from berlin**

👀 I’m interested in design systems, semantics and usability but also very nerdy typography, grids, colors and stuff like that can fill my day with joy

🌱 I’m currently learning JS... since ever. but i honestly will never learn it properly

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything which is interesting to invest time and energy in
